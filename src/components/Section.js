                    <h2>Trust Bizimungu Pascal</h2>
                    <p>Kabano is an associate at Bytelex advocates,
                        currently stationed in Rwanda. He brings a foreign perspective to the team with his
                        understanding of both Ugandan and Rwandan law. He uses this diverse background to provide legal advice that
                        exceeds borders and takes into account the regional legal status quo in the tech start up space. Kabanoâ€™s
                        passion for helping others is what drives his legal career.
                        He holds a Bachelor of Laws degree from Makerere university school of law and a Diploma in Legal practice from the law development centre in Uganda.</p>
